I am a second year Robotics Ph.D. student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), working with [Prof. Celine Lin](https://eiclab.scs.gatech.edu/pages/team.html) and [Prof. Danfei Xu](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~danfei/). I got my Master degree at Georgia Tech and bachelor degree in robotics engineering at Southern University of Science and Technology [SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/).

I am interested in robot learning ðŸ¤– and working on making robots more smarter ðŸ§ . I believe advancing robotics is the key for helping humanity to ask the right questions and improve lives of people.

Outside class and lab, I enjoy playing guitars, mountain biking, racing drones, hiking, chatting with people about everything interesting in the world.

<!-- Control and playing with dynamics is one of the most beautiful things in the nature, especially in animals movements and in human sports. Building hardware and design control algorithms to replicate those behaviors in robots is a goal of mine, which can also help us understand the science behind mother nature. -->
